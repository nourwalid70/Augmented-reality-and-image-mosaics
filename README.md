# Augmented-reality-and-image-mosaics
## Part 1:Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies
An AR application using planar homographies. First, point correspondences between two images are found and used to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography, images are warped to create the final AR application.

## Part 2: Image Mosaics
An image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. There are two input images that should form the mosaic, where one image is warpped into the plane of the second image and the combined view is finally displayed.
